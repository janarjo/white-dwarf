# white-dwarf
An asteroids-like game being made with Typescript and using an Entity-Component-System architecture.

Currently this is just a hobby project I occasionally work on to learn Typescript and composition based architecture.

It is setup with snowpack and will create a local server where it will deploy the compiled bundle and start watch.
Simply run ```npm start```.
